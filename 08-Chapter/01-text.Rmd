## 8.1 Limits of Sequences of Numbers

### Definitions and notation

An __infinite sequence__ (or __sequence__) of numbers is a function whose domain
is the set of integers greater than or equal to some integer $n_0$.

Usually $n_0$ is 1 and the domain of the sequence is the set of positive
integers. But sometimes we want to start sequences elsewhere. We take $n_0 = 0$
when we begin Newton's method. We might take $n_0 = 3$ if we were defining a
sequence of $n$-sided polygons.

Sequences are defined the way other functions are, some typical rules being

$$
\begin{aligned}
a(n) = \sqrt{n},\ \ \ & a(n) = (-1)^{n+1}\frac{1}{n},\ & a(n) = \frac{n - 1}{n}
\end{aligned}
$$
